Today is good so far. Going to get things done well after the lectures. My aim
is to stay in quite late doing the 351 assignment and the lab. Trying to get
those done early so that I have some more time to do other things.

Things are going okish today. The plan is to continue on the 370 assignment and
see where I get with that. Other than that I am going to go to the industry
night tonight and am also going to go to the gym sometime today. I also have to
do to the lab for 351. Don't forget that! I have it on my calander so I
shouldn't forget...

Today is going good, all i have to do is 760 assignment 1 and study for the
test. I also just have to finish off the 370 assignment 1 but that should be
pretty easy, it's just a lot of work to get that report done I think. Make sure
that you're looking at the rubric!!!
