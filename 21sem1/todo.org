This is just a recap of where I'm at
*** 370
This course is generally going well. I think that I understand all of the
concepts. The only thing that I have to do is kinda keep up with the notes on
the course. In terms of the assignment I have completed all the steps except for
number 4. And even with #4 I'm pretty far through it and should be able to get
it done. Another thing that I have to do for the assignment is the writeup. The
writeup might to a little longer than what I expect.
*** 351
I have completed lab2 for this week. I have completed questions 1,2,3 of the
assignment and just have to do question 4 (which I expect to take the longest)
but it shouldn't take more than like 3 hours or whatever so it's not too too
bad.
*** 760
You have a lot of work to do for this course holy shit. There is assignment 1
which has just been released and it looks pretty hard. But the course content
isn't too bad there's just a lot of it (mainly because it's pretty simple).  You
should start this assignment on monday or something

OVERALL:
**** DONE 370 a1
     DEADLINE: <2021-03-21 Sun>
You should do this assignment first
**** DONE 351 a1
     DEADLINE: <2021-03-21 Sun>

Then just work on 760 as you please. Just keep an active look over on the notes

** DONE <2021-04-28 Wed>
- This afternoon what I want to achieve is going through all my notes for the
  past two weeks or so and then understanding them. You also have to watch
  todays lectures and firdays lecture for 351. Fuck that's a lot of
  work. Alright let's get on with this
** DONE <2021-04-29 Thu>
Things that I have to do today (on order of importance)
- Catch up on 370 lecture, before that you need to catch up mentally to the
  class
- Catch up on 760 lecture where you completely understand the previous lecture
- Start the assignment for 760
- Touch up assignment 2 for 351
Goals:
- Before this weekend I want to be completely up to date with all of my classes,
  where I have finished all of the assignments (except for 760) so that I am up
  to date and can attend future lectures. Don't be a loser where you have to
  watch lectures online. That's a slippery slope for you.
