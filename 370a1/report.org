** Machine statistics
- OS: My machine uses the LTS version of Ubuntu 20 (Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS x86_64)
  using a 64bit architecture
- CPU: Single CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 2600) which has 6 cores (multi-core) and 12
  threads. Each core is clocked at 3.4GHz (base clock)
- Memory: 16GB of memory with 2GB of swap
The Ubuntu OS is running natively (ie: *not* running on a virtual machine)

* Step 0
Although my machine did not run into memory problems (modified the program to
call ~free(combined)~ in the ~merge~ step of the mergesort, the sorting of the
arrays started to take a significant amount of time (2 secs and 622246
microseconds) using an argument of ~25~ (IE: sorting an array of length 2^25)

Sorting arrays beyond length ~2^25~ would be typically infeasible for any
reasonable application (for array sorting at least) due to time constraints (*time
pressure*). Below is the resource monitor on an array of size ~2^26~ (using ~26~
as an input to the program
